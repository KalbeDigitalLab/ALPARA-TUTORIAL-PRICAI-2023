# ALPARA-TUTORIAL-PRICAI-2023


Welcome to the AlpaRA project repository! In this project, we provide a comprehensive tutorial for developing a large language model using LLAMA and the Alpaca configuration. Additionally, we've implemented LoRA to enable the deployment of the developed AI model in consumer devices.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to guide you through the process of creating a sophisticated text generation model capable of simulating patient and doctor conversations. The underlying model is based on the GenMedGPT 5k dataset obtained from ChatDoctor.
